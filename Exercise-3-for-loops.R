#####      SIMULATE THE GAME OF CRAPS        #####
##################################################

# The game of craps is played as follows. First, 
# you roll two six-sided dice; let x be the sum of
# the dice on the first roll. If x = 7 or 11 you 
# win, otherwise you keep rolling until either you 
# get x again, in which case you also win, or
# until you get a 7 or 11, in which case you lose.

# Write a program to simulate a game of craps. You 
# can use the following snippet of code to simulate 
# the roll of two (fair) dice:

# x <- sum(ceiling(6*runif(2)))
